The project is Binged.TV!

Binged.TV is an app you can track and mark 'watched' episodes of tv series. Inspired by an urban culture term: "binge watching"

It is a native Android app integrated with APIs such as Trakt.tv and Twitter. It can list binge-worthy tv shows for you and you can binge a tv show with a single tap.
